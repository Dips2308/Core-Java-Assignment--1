The Retail Store Discounts

On a retail website, the following discounts apply:
1. If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount
2. If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
3. If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
4. For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45
as a discount).
5. The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries.
6. A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.

This program is based on to calculate the final bill after purchase of needs. There are some discounts available for different individual and for different types of product. After successful discount the final bill will be generated.
